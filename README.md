# Laravel Cloudflare

The Cloudflare API for Laravel 10-12

[See documentation](https://github.com/joshuapack/laravel-cloudflare/wiki)

## How to Install

First do `composer require joshuapack/laravel-cloudflare`

Get the following information.

1. Your Cloudflare email, simple, the one you use to log in with.
2. Your Cloudflare API Key, found in your account settings.
3. The Zone ID for the domain you want to edit, this is on the main page for the domain.

Put them in your `.env` as the following, obviously and respectively.

1. `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL`
2. `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`
3. `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, the preferred way. [Create a token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/). 
4. `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`

## How to use

There is a Facade `CloudFlare`

You can also use `$cf = app()->make('laravel-cloudflare')`

Then use `$cf` to make the calls like `$cf->setZoneId('12312312312312312312323')`

For example, you could then list the records like so
`$cf->listRecords()`
Which would return a collection of your records for that zone.

## Current Getters/Setters

- `zoneId`

## Current Methods

- `listZones`
- `addRecord`
- `listRecords`
- `getRecordDetails`
- `updateRecordDetails`

## Direct Queries

You can see all API calls [https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-php] for direct querying, however, we only have a couple available at this time.

- `queryDNS`
- `queryFirewall`
- `queryFirewallSettings`
- `queryZones`
- `queryZoneSettings`

## Query Any Cloudflare Endpoint from SDK

You can now direct all API calls from the SDK [https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-php]. Use the `queryCloudflare()` method. See wiki for examples and more details [https://github.com/joshuapack/laravel-cloudflare/wiki/Query-Cloudflare]

If you have any questions feel free to ask in the issues tab on github. Same with adding more direct queries or other methods.
